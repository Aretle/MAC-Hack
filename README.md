# MAC-Hack
This repository is for team collaboration on the MAC Hackathon 2021.
## Summary
We plan to create a application for use by disability support workers, their clients, and the client's families. Right now, a manual approach is taken regarding the communication between support workers and client's families, there are a number of challenges associated withh this approach. For example: a hand-written notebook is kept on site containing notes from previous workers to pass important information between carers and it is easy to lose or miss sensitive information, the family must reach out to each worker indivudually to notify them of any client appointments during their shifts, new shift workers aren't familiar with the requirements of the particular client, etc.

## Design
The application is expected to run in fullscreen throughout the day in the room/house of a client so that it can easily be viewed at all times by the client and caretaker. Some information is only important only to the carer, so the client doesn't need to see everything while there is no-one on shift. When a carer ends their shift the app will provide them with the functionality to quickly and easily inform relevant parties (doctor, family) as to the health and well-being of their client.

## MVP
For now ideally the app provides the functionality to:
#### _Careworkers_
- Notify interested parties as to the health and well-being of the client at the end of each day
- Pass notes from one shift to the next
- View/set appointments
- View shift tasks

#### _Client_
- See which carers are coming in at what time

#### _Interested Parties_
- Be notified as to the health/well-being of the client
- View/Edit appointments

## Future
Besides expanding upon the MVP features, additional features can be added outside of the MVP. For example:
- Meal planner
- Medicine tracker
- Reminders
- Family contact information

Consideration also has to be made as to the security of sensitive data. Furthermore, how to make the application expandable for additional clients and carers.
